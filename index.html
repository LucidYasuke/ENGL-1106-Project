							<h1>To What Extent Does A Character's Flaw Progress A Narrative?</h1>
							<p class="major">Character depth is important in a fictional story. Multi-dimensional characters normally exhibit internal conflic or multiple factes to their character. Flaws are an aspect of a character that when used correctly, progresses the character, characters around them, and narrative as a whole.<br><br>My research will focus on character flaws in western movies and Japanese Animation (Anime) and analyze the importance of flawed characters in a narrative.</p>

							<h2>What is a Flaw?</h2>
							<p>A Flaw in the Cambridge Dictionary is defined as "a fault, mistake, or weakness, especially one that happens while something is being planned or made or that cause something to not be perfect". A charachter such as Luffy from the Japanese Anime "One Piece" when finally being dealt with lost not only changed the character, but the world and it's characters as a whole. The stakes became higher and a more intense narrative began.</p>

							<h2>Audience</h2>
							<p>My ideal audience is viewers of anime and writers working on characters. However, movies will also be focused on creating a bigger audience of general media enjoyers. I want to examine how an author creates his/her characters as well as show appreciation for said character. Finding what common flaws are used in characters to flesh them out. As well as how these flaws effect the world.</p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>Ideally, I will analyze works of fiction. I will focus on one or more characters and determine a flaw or multiple flaws. I will then analyze if this flaw caused a changing point in the story. While doing this, I will take notes of the most popular flaws between these works of fiction. Alternatively, I will watch video analysis on these same works of fiction in order to get other points of views on these characters, the world, and their flaws. Movies and Japanese Animation are my primary targets. Movies will help with time efficiency as they are shorter than television series.</p>
